          <h1>Resources</h1>
          <p>
            Donating unused components like Arduino boards, sensors, or other electronics can make a huge difference for aspiring inventors. These parts allow young creators to experiment, learn, and develop their ideas without worrying about the cost of materials. Even small contributions, like wires or LEDs, can help complete a project. By donating, you’re giving inventors the tools they need to create, innovate, and problem-solve. Your resources fuel their potential and inspire the next generation of thinkers.
          </p>

        <div class="donationtype fadein">
          <h1>Technology</h1>
          <p>
            Technology donations, whether functional or in need of repair, are invaluable to our cause. These contributions allow us to provide hands-on learning experiences for inventors eager to explore coding, electronics, and mechanics. Donated devices such as laptops, tablets, or even robotics kits can be repurposed for workshops and labs. Your technology could be the foundation for the next breakthrough idea or invention. With your help, we can empower creators to imagine, design, and build confidently.
          </p>

        <div class="donationtype fadein">
          <h1>Finance</h1>
          <p>
            Financial donations are essential to sustaining the Little Inventor Charity and expanding our reach. By contributing to our fund, you directly support grants, scholarships, and resource access for young innovators. Your generosity helps cover the costs of mentorship programs, workshops, and materials. Every dollar donated allows us to nurture talent and fund projects that might otherwise be out of reach. Together, we can make sure that every inventor has the support they need to bring their ideas to life.

        <div class="donationtype fadein">
          <h1>Mentorship</h1>
          <p>
            Share your expertise by becoming a mentor for the Little Inventor community. Your guidance can be invaluable for young creators, helping them overcome challenges, refine their ideas, and gain confidence in their abilities. Whether your background is in engineering, design, programming, or project management, your experience can inspire and shape the next generation of inventors. Mentorship isn’t just about teaching; it’s about connecting and nurturing innovation through real-world advice and encouragement.
